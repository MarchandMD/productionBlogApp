# Notes
Alright, so I'm switching from my Development and production environment, to working strictly in the Production copy of my application. This is because I ffeel like the app is working correctly, and any change I make I'll want to push to production, via the HHeroku command line. 

Bbut maybe the thing I should be doing is moving to a new branch. I mean, i can still work in the production environment, but I can work on a differnt bbranch then the master branch. 

And this would be good practice for me working on a different branch. 

I mean, that makes it an even more "production" like environment I feel. Where I'm doing work on a "development" branch in the "production" app. 

So what shoudl I do? I mean, if Robert is doing some work, what can I work on? What should I work on? I mean, there's some basic things. Like Navigation. 

I know that requires working with the views and the layouts....

I mean, if that's something that I want to do, I think I can take the time to do that. And I can explore it as much as I want, because I'm not in a rush to get to production anymnore. Or I'm not in an eternal battle to struggle with getting an application to production. Because as far as I can tell, I ahve one. 

BBut I'd like to continue forward with the tutorial, the getting started application. So I'll do taht.
