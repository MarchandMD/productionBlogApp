# Notes
Alright, so I'm switching from my Development and production environment, to working strictly in the Production copy of my application. This is because I ffeel like the app is working correctly, and any change I make I'll want to push to production, via the HHeroku command line. 

Bbut maybe the thing I should be doing is moving to a new branch. I mean, i can still work in the production environment, but I can work on a differnt bbranch then the master branch. 

And this would be good practice for me working on a different branch. 

I mean, that makes it an even more "production" like environment I feel. Where I'm doing work on a "development" branch in the "production" app.
